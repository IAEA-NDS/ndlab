Introduction
=============

| **NDlab** is a package for nuclear (mainly)structure data analysis, calculation, and modelling. 
| It caters for users that need to process and navigate the data via software, having no knowledge about the formats and data structures of the original data libraries. 

.. attention::

   Please consult the :ref:`Database section <database-label>` to assess whether the NDLab dabase fits your needs, 
   and note that for accurate structure and decay description, one should revert to the `ENSDF <https://nndc.bnl.gov/ensdf>`_ database.


| Ndlab is available on GitHub ???
| and it comprises:

* an engine to retrive data and plug them into data manipulation tools like `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html>`_ and `plotly <https://plotly.com/python/>`_

* a set of Python classes and functions to write custom code 
* a Notebook with tutorial 

Its main features are:

* intuitive way to interrogate the database
* smooth connection to Python data analysis and plotting packages
* customizable Pyhton modules to write algorithms and simulations
* automatic propagation of uncertainties when performing calculations
* option to directly access the underlying SQL database


| In case you wanted to collaborate to the development, you should write

Besides this documentation, the package comprises ndlab-tutorial.ipynb, a Notebook with live exercises and examples.
