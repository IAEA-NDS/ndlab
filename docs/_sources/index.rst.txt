Beta Testing User Guide
=======================

| **NDlab** is a package for nuclear (mainly)structure data analysis, calculation, and modelling. 
| It caters for users that need to process and navigate the data via software, having no knowledge about the formats and data structures of the original data libraries. 

.. attention::

   Please consult the :ref:`Database section <database-label>` to assess whether the NDLab dabase fits your needs, 
   and note that for accurate structure and decay description, one should revert to the `ENSDF <https://nndc.bnl.gov/ensdf>`_ database.


| Ndlab is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/IAEA-NDS/ndlab/>`_ under MIT license,
| and it comprises:

* an engine to retrive data and plug them into data manipulation tools like `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html>`_ and `plotly <https://plotly.com/python/>`_

* a set of Python classes and functions to write custom code 
* a Notebook with tutorial, see the introductory video

   </div>
   <div style="margin-bottom:30px">&nbsp;</div>


Its main features are:

* intuitive way to interrogate the database
* smooth connection to Python data analysis and plotting packages
* customizable Pyhton modules to write algorithms and simulations
* automatic propagation of uncertainties when performing calculations
* option to directly access the underlying SQL database
